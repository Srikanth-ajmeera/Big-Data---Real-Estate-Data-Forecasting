# 🏘️ Real Estate Data Forecasting

**A Big Data Time Series Forecasting Project using Zillow Housing Dataset**  
📍 *IIT Roorkee | Feb 2025 – Mar 2025*

---

## 📊 Problem Statement

The goal is to analyze long-term trends in US housing prices and forecast future values using statistical and deep learning models.

---

## 🧠 Methods Used

- Data Cleaning & Interpolation
- Time Series Decomposition
- Linear Regression, ARIMA
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network)
- Evaluation via MAE/RMSE

---

## 📁 Data Source

- **Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI)**: 20+ years of monthly housing prices for 400+ US cities
- Publicly available from [Zillow Research Portal](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/)

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- High volatility in cities like Los Angeles and New York.
- Strong seasonality across all cities.
- 2008 crash & COVID-19 had visible impacts.
- LSTM outperformed ARIMA in forecasting accuracy.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

`Python`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Statsmodels`, `TensorFlow/Keras`, `scikit-learn`

---

## 🧪 Future Work

- GridSearchCV + K-Fold tuning
- Transformer-based models for long-range dependency
- Regional segmentation-based modeling
